Subject: Questions and Homework Submission for Our Next Class

Dear Julia Smirnova,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to reach out to clarify a few things regarding our upcoming class and also submit my homework.

Firstly, I have a couple of questions about the next class:

1. Will there be any specific topics or chapters that we will be focusing on during the session?
2. Are there any additional materials or resources you would recommend for better preparation?

I would appreciate it if you could provide some insights on these points, as it would greatly help me to make the most out of our class.

Furthermore, I would like to inform you that this email includes an attached file with my completed homework. 
I have put in my best effort to ensure its completion and would be grateful if you could take a look at it during your review.

Please let me know if there are any specific guidelines or instructions for submitting the homework, or if you require any further information from my end.

Thank you in advance for your guidance and support. I look forward to our next class and the opportunity to learn more.

Best regards,
Konstantin Evstigneev
